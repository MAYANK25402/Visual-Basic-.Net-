This repository is all about the Visual Basic(.Net) programming language developed by Microsoft.

It is an object oriented based programming which works on the class and object concept.

In this repository I will be adding the concepts that I have learnt during my Bachelors and some concepts durig the Internship as well.

It is like c# that we use in the day to day problems but exactly not like it but it will not take time to understand and will be easily understandable.
